1

    When war clouds dim the sunshine
        And shadow all the land,
    When our country goes to battle
        With foes on every hand,
    ’Tis then the call comes clear
        To loyal hearts and true
    To lay down their lives and fortunes
        For our own red, white and blue.


2

    Our lovely starry banner
        Defeat must never know,
    For it stands for truth and freedom
        Where’er its colors blow.
    Then pledge your faith anew
        A vow to Liberty,
    Which shall never cease to bless us
        ’Neath the banner of the free.

_Enter Uncle Sam, a boy dressed in usual costume. He stands in center
of stage while girls who sang group themselves at back of stage._

UNCLE SAM:

    I am America’s Uncle Sam,
          Democracy’s pioneer.
    I have sent a message across the sea
          That other lands may hear;
    And there comes to us now a call for aid
          For her cause has suffered harm,
    And Democracy turns for protection now
          To your Uncle Sam’s strong right arm.
    And I—in turn—am asking you
          What help you will give to me,
    And what will you do to make the world
          Safe for Democracy.
    A splendid army you’ve given me
          But the fight has just begun
    And men must be training all the time
          For the work is not yet done.
    So teach the little children, too,
          A patriotic zeal
    And they will be ready, if ever there’s need,
          To answer a world’s appeal.

_Enter 12 small boys in soldier suits. They advance to front of stage,
Uncle Sam standing at one side. At conclusion of speeches soldiers
step to back of stage. Each group take same positions before and after
speaking and singing._

ALL SOLDIERS:

          When each of us becomes a man
          He’ll be a soldier if he can.

     1st. I’d like to be a drummer boy.
          I’d beat a charge with vim and joy.

     2nd. I’d be a trumpeter. I’d never sound retreat
          But call the men from hill and glen the enemy to meet.

     3rd. I’d love to be a gunner and make the cannon roar.
          A lot of gunners, brave and strong, I’m sure would end this war.

     4th. I’ll be an aviator and like a bird I’ll fly
          Within my shining airship, away up in the sky.

     5th. I’ll drive a Red Cross ambulance and all the wounded men
          I’ll take away from battle fields, till they are well again.

     6th. Some one must feed the soldiers and I think I’d like to cook.
          I don’t know how to do it, but you learn it from a book.

     7th. I’d love to ride on horseback in every big parade,
          But when it comes to battles I think I’d be afraid.

     8th. I’d like to be a general, like Joffre, so good and wise
          And find myself a hero in every nation’s eyes.

     9th. I’d like to be as famous as the mighty General Foche
          Who leads the allied armies to war against the Boche.

    10th. I’d like to lead our army like General Pershing, he
          Is just the biggest hero in all the world to me.

    11th. I guess I’ll be a private. We can’t all heroes be,
          But anyway, I know I’ll serve my country faithfully.

    12th. I’ll be the color bearer and hold our flag on high,
          And always, o’er the battle field, it will in victory fly.

     All. We’ll serve our country and our flag and serve them faithfully
          And all be valiant soldiers when men we grow to be.

UNCLE SAM:

    Don’t fail to help the Red Cross, too,
        Theirs is a noble task,
    They ease the dying, cure the hurt,
        So give whene’er they ask.

_Enter any number girls dressed as Red Cross nurses. They sing air,
“Yankee Doodle”._

1.

    We’ll bandage you and bleed you, too,
        We’ll give you pills and potions,
    We’ll bathe your hot and aching brow
        With cool and soothing lotions.

CHORUS.

    Red Cross nurses wise are we
        Red Cross nurses dandy,
    If you get wounded don’t be scared,
        You’ll always find us handy.

2.

    We’ll tend the wounded under fire
        In scientific manner,
    We’ll do our best for all who fight
        Beneath our starry banner. CHORUS.

UNCLE SAM:

    Children can help to win the war
        If they save each penny and dime.
    If they do without candy and movies and gum
        They’ll have a quarter in time.
    And a quarter will buy a Thrift Stamp
        So, children, all of you try
    For every little Thrift Stamp
        Is a War Stamp by and by.

_Enter 12 girls in white holding green cards on which are huge white
letters spelling Thrift Stamps._

     1st. Tiny little Thrift Stamps, bright and green and new,

     2nd. Help us on to victory. Won’t you buy a few?

     3rd. Reach into your pocket, just a dime each day

     4th. If you only give it for many things will pay.

     5th. Food and ships and shelter, clothing, swords and guns

     6th. Till an army, well equipped, goes to fight the Huns.

     7th. Save your pennies, children, send them o’er the foam,

     8th. Till the war is over and the boys come home.

     9th. Are you patriotic? Then you musn’t shirk.

    10th. Make your pennies soldiers, make your quarters work.

    11th. Proud you’ll be of helping when the war is done,

    12th. So buy a Thrift Stamp every day till the fight is won.

     All. Do your bit for Uncle Sam, Make your money fight
          Till the strife is ended with victory for the right.

UNCLE SAM:

    Every War Saving Stamp that you buy
      Is a step on the road to Berlin.
    So purchase as many as ever you can
      And the war we soon shall win.

_Enter any number girls in green with letters W S S on waist. Letters
may be cut from white paper. They sing, air, “Coming Through the Rye”._

1.

    We are stamps of vast importance
        Everybody knows.
    Every sale of us, remember,
        Helps defeat our foes.

CHORUS.

    Saving Stamps you all must purchase—
        Help the war to win,
    So send us smiling on our way
        Until we reach Berlin!

2.

    Save your pennies, dimes and quarters
        Save them constantly
    Till you have enough to buy us,
        Send us o’er the sea. CHORUS.

UNCLE SAM:

    If you can’t fight your money can—
        Don’t own a slacker dollar,
    But send it straightway “Over There”
        ’Twill make the kaiser holler!
    Buy bonds, buy bonds for Liberty
        And loan the U S A
    Each cent that you can live without,
        ’Twill surely save the day.

_Enter 12 girls in white with red, white and blue sashes and gilt paper
crowns, to represent Liberty. They carry red letters spelling_ LIBERTY
BONDS.

   1st. Let every patriot do his best and help to win the war with zest.

   2nd. Invest your money in a bond, and to your country’s call respond.

   3rd. Better a loan to win the war than tribute to a conqueror.

   4th. Even the smallest bond may save the life of many a soldier
             brave.

   5th. Remember if you do not go your money should, so don’t be slow.

   6th. To save Democracy we fight so aid the cause with all your might.

   7th. You know we’re in the fight to stay so buy a bond or two today.

   8th. Be generous, it is the due of those who give their lives for
             you.

   9th. Over the seas, amid the fray, their fate depends on us today.

  10th. Now let us send with lavish hand our money to the gallant band.

  11th. Don’t put it off, don’t hesitate, next month, next year, may be
             too late.

  12th. So buy a bond for Liberty, and send your money o’er the sea.

UNCLE SAM:

    I view with pride my bold marines
        Who sail the raging sea.
    As fighters they are wonderful,
        So fierce and brave they be.

_Enter 10 boys in sailor costume. They sing, air, “Sailing”._

1.

    Heave ho! my lads. We must away
    And anchor raise while yet ’tis day
    For far across the waters blue
    Our bark will bear its gallant crew.
    Our country’s foes we gladly go to fight
    While o’er us floats our starry banner bright.

CHORUS.

    Then here’s to our country and here’s to the red, white and blue
    May it wave in every port the wide world thru.
    Sailing, sailing, over the dashing foam
    Full many a stormy sky shall frown
    Ere the sailor lads come home.

2.

    We’ll chase the U-boats from the sea—
    They shall no more a danger be,
    And he who sails the ocean clear
    With us to guide need have no fear.
    We’re bold marines who dearly love to fight
    While o’er us floats our starry banner bright.

_They may do Sailor’s Hornpipe if desired._

UNCLE SAM:

    You all have heard the story
        How the Minute Men of old
    Were ever at their Country’s call—
        So watchful and so bold.
    They carried warning thru the night
        Which led to victory
    And gathered all the patriots
        To fight for Liberty.
    Like them are my Four Minute Men
        Who speak instead of fight
    And urge a listening country
        To aid the cause of right.

_Four Minute Men—Five boys dressed in colonial costume if desired._

    1st. In every large assembly
         We’re always sure to be.

    2nd. We speak on many subjects
         Dear to Democracy.

    3rd. We speak about the Stamps and Bonds
         And urge you all to buy.

    4th. Because it’s necessary
         And tell the reason why.

    5th. We thus reach many people
         Who otherwise would say
         “No one asked me to buy a thing”
         And try to shirk that way.

    All. We’re like the Minute Men of old
         Altho we do not fight
         We bring a warning message
         That you may aid the right.

UNCLE SAM:

    My aviators rule the air
    They wing their way on high
    And soon they’ll drive the enemy
    Forever from the sky.

_Aviators—11 boys in aviator’s costume. 5 of them speak._

    1st. We’re Uncle Sam’s birdmen, with temperament strange
         For we’re usually up in the air
         When it comes to a fight with a foe in the clouds
         No others with us can compare.

    2nd. We swoop thru the air like a bird on the wing
         We circle, we dive, and we rise.
         High up o’er the world with our hearts free from care
         We speed on our path thru the skies.

    3rd. If the plane of an enemy ever approaches
         In battle we promptly engage.
         Till the foe falls in ruins, down, down to the earth
         Our warfare relentless we wage.

    4th. With nerves that are steady, with eyes that are keen
         We traverse the uncharted blue
         And we call to the stars and the moon as we pass
         And they twinkle as if they all knew.

    5th. From the skies of the world all intruders we’ll drive
         And the air raids shall quite cease to be
         When we’re finished there won’t be a Zeppelin left
         To annoy this fair land of the free.

_They sing, air, “Kentucky Home”. This is very effective if accompanied
with appropriate gestures._

1.

    Just gaze on us, for we’re aviators bold
    We circle and turn in the air.
    We loop the loop and we dive and mount and glide
    And our hearts are gay and free from care.
    Our eyes are bright and our nerves are firm as steel
    We’re rising—we’re sinking below—
    We show the world that we’re monarchs of the air
    As far up above the clouds we go.

CHORUS.

    Left—then right—we’re swerving—
    And now we drop below
    Then we rise on high, soaring thru the pathless sky
    Far, far up above the clouds we shall go.

2.

    My aeroplane will respond to every wish
    It hums as it rises on high.
    It seems to love thus to leave the world behind
    Like a bird it wings across the sky
    The sun by day and the twinkling stars at night
    Look down in amaze and surprise
    Our hearts will thrill as the wild wind whistles past
    While we wing our swift way thru the skies.

CHORUS.

UNCLE SAM:

    A hungry army can never fight,
        So we must feed our men,
    And the one who stays at home and plants
        In every meadow and glen
    And raises the grain to give them bread
        Is patriot, brave and true
    As any soldier who fights today
        ’Neath the red, the white, the blue.

_Enter farmers, 10 boys in overalls and straw hats, carrying hoes,
rakes, etc. They sing, air, “Vive L’Amour”._

1.

    We plant and we spade and we rake and we hoe
        All for the soldier boys,
    We dig and we harrow, we plant and we sow,
        All for our soldier boys.

CHORUS.

    Sing of the farmers, the patriots true
    Raising the wheat and the golden corn too.
    Gladly we toil, tilling the soil,
        All for our soldier boys.

2.

    We’ll feed all the allies till victory is won
        Won by our soldier boys,
    And welcome them home when their great task is done,
        Welcome our soldier boys. CHORUS.

UNCLE SAM:

    With helpers such as these ’tis plain
        Our victory is assured,
    And not in vain the hardships
        Our brave boys have endured.
    We’ll make the whole wide world today
        Safe for Democracy,
    And the Stars and Stripes shall ever float
        O’er the Land of Liberty.

_All sing, air, “Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes”._

1.

    All hail the banner of the free, the bonny Stripes and Stars.
    Of purity the white stars speak, no stain their beauty mars.
    A sign of valor you may read within its crimson bars
    The blue field stands for truth and hope, illumined by Heaven’s
             own stars.

2.

    O’er it the light of victory shall ever brightly shine.
    For freedom, justice and the right, ’twill ever be the sign.
    Then may it proudly float on high, this flag of yours and mine.
    And may the bonny Stripes and Stars with added lustre shine.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
